[Mapbox GL](https://www.mapbox.com/blog/mapbox-gl/) style specification and
reference.

This repository contains the [specification](STYLE.md) and reference for
the JSON-based style descriptions used in Mapbox GL, and
is meant to be used as a guideline for building and testing implementations.

## Reference

The JSON reference to properties and syntax is usable as a module in npm:

    npm install --save mapbox-gl-style-spec

The API is a simple object of the reference.
