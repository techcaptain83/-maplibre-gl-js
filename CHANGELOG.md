## dev

An in-progress version being developed in the `mb-pages` branch.

#### Improvements

- Switched to a different fill outlines rendering approach. [#668](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js/issues/668)
- Made the minified build 12% smaller gzipped (66 KB now).
- Added `around` option to `Map` `zoomTo`/`rotateTo`.

#### Bugfixes

- Fixed the **broken minified build**. [#679](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js/issues/679)
- Fixed **blurry icons** rendering. [#666](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js/issues/666)
- Fixed `util.supports` WebGL detection producing false positives in some cases. [#677](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js/issues/677)
- Fixed invalid font configuration completely blocking tile rendering.  [#662](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-js/issues/662)
- Fixed `Map` `project`/`unproject` to properly accept array-form values.
- Fixed a bug that broke the map on single-core CPUs in some cases.

## 0.2.1 (Aug 8 2014)

#### Breaking

- Changed `Navigation` control signature: now it doesn't need `map` in constructor
and gets added with `map.addControl(nav)` or `nav.addTo(map)`.
- Updated CSS classes to have consistent naming prefixed with `mapboxgl-`.

#### Improvements

- Added attribution control (present by default, disable by passing `attributionControl: false` in options).
- Added rotation by dragging the compass control.
- Added grabbing cursors for the map by default.
- Added `util.inherit` and `util.debounce` functions.
- Changed the default debug page style to OSM Bright.
- Token replacements now support dashes.
- Improved navigation control design.

#### Bugfixes

- Fixed compass control to rotate its icon with the map.
- Fixed navigation control cursors.
- Fixed inertia going to the wrong direction in a rotated map.
- Fixed inertia race condition where error was sometimes throwed after erratic panning/zooming.


## 0.2.0 (Aug 6 2014)

- First public release.
